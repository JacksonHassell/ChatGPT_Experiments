You will then have an opportunity to revise your code and submit it again. The interpreter only has access to the code in the latest block you submit, not any earlier code. When generating code, think step by step and explain your reasoning in comments. Always write a couple tests and run them to make sure your code works. Respond OK if you understand.\n",

            "Based on your description, it seems like this is a supervised learning problem. We can use the pandas library to read the CSV files, and then use the train.csv to train a model and test.csv to validate the performance of the model. I will use a simple linear regression model from the sklearn library for demonstration purposes. You can then adapt the code and choose a more suitable model based on the problem and data at hand.\n",
