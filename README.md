# ChatGPT Experiments

This is just a repository for my experiments in the OpenAI API dabbling with ChatGPT and GPT-4.

ChatGPT_ToolUse has my research into how GPT-4 uses tools. This includes augmenting it with access to the internet, giving it access to a code interpreter, and creating a general-purpose tool framework to quickly add and remove various tools from its repertoire.

ChatGPT_Personality is my experiments with giving ChatGPT a personality. ChatGPT's typical style is very professional and distant, and there are many cases where you'd want it to act according to a more lively personality. I also tested OpenAI's alignment here, seeing how the model refuses to act out certain toxic personalities, and seeing where it draws that line between toxic and non-toxic.
